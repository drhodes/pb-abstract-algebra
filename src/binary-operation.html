        A <b>binary operation</b> `\circ` on a set `G` is a function
        `\circ : G \times G \to G`. For an element `(a, b) \in G \times G`,
        
        the image of `(a, b)` under `\circ` is denoted `a
        \circ b` (or just juxtaposition `ab` when the operation is
        clear from context), that is, `(a, b) \to a \circ b`. We will
        use the notation `(G, \circ)` to denote that `G` is a set and
        `\circ` a binary operation on `G`.

    <p>
        In Lean, the idea of a binary operation is represented
        naturally as a simple funtion with type: `\alpha \to \alpha
        \to \alpha`. <code>Group</code> extends the <code>Mul</code> typeclass
        that defines <code>mul</code> as a function type
    </p>
    
    <mathlib file="src/lean/Init/Prelude.lean" from="1326" to="1329"/>

    
    <p> <code>Group</code> extends a lot of different typeclasses, but
        for now we don't need to worry about that. If you're curious you
        can always <b>goto-definition</b> within your editor and poke around. </p>
