    <h3>Theorem 1.2.21</h3>
    <p>
        Let `f: A \to B`, `g: B \to C`, and `h: C \to D`. Then:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>(a) The composition of mappings is associative, that is,
            \[(h \circ g) \circ f = h \circ (g \circ f).\]
        </li>
        <li>(b) If `f` and `g` are both surjective, then `g \circ f` is surjective;
        </li>
        <li>(c) If `f` and `g` are both injective, then `g \circ f` is injective;
        </li>
        <li>(d) If `f` and `g` are both bijective, then `g \circ f` is bijective.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <proof>

        <h4>Proof</h4>
        <p>
            Let `a \in A`. Then
        </p>
        <p class="formula">
            \[[(h \circ g) \circ f](a) = (h \circ g)(f(a)) = h(g(f(a))) = h((g \circ f)(a)) = [h \circ (g \circ
            f)](a),\]
        </p>
        <p>
            which proves (a).
        </p>
        <p>
            Let `c \in C`. Since `g` is surjective, there exists
            some `b \in B` such that `g(b) = c`. Likewise, since
            `f` is surjective, there exists some `a \in A` such
            that `f(a) = b`. Thus,
        </p>

        <p class="formula">
            \[(g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)) = g(b) = c,\]
        </p>
        <p>
            which proves (b). Part (c) is left as an exercise to
            the student, and part (d) follows immediately from (b)
            and (c).
        </p>
    </proof>
