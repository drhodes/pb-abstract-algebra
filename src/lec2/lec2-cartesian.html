            The function of education is to teach one to think
            intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus
            character – that is the goal of true education.

                Given sets `A` and `B`, we can define a new set `A
                \times B`, called the Cartesian product of `A` and
                `B`, as a set of ordered pairs. That is,
                
                \[ A \times B = \{ (a, b) \mid a \in A \text{ and } b \in B \}. \]
                
                We define the Cartesian product of `n` sets to be

                \[
                \prod_{i=1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \times \dots \times A_n =
                \{ (a_1, \dots, a_n) \mid a_i \in A_i \text{ for } i = 1, \dots, n \}.
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                If `A = A_1 = A_2 = \dots = A_n`, we often write `A^n` for
                `A \times \dots \times A` (with `A` written `n`
                times). For example, the set `\mathbb{R}^3` consists of
                all 3‑tuples of real numbers.

            If `A = \{x, y\}`, `B = \{1, 2, 3\}`, and `C = \varnothing`, then 
            `A \times B` is the set
            
            \[A \times B = \{ (x, 1), (x, 2), (x, 3), (y, 1), (y, 2), (y, 3) \} \]
