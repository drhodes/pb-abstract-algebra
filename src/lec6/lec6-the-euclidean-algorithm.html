        <p>Let `a` and `b` be integers. If `b = ak` for some integer `k`, we write `a \mid b`. An integer `d` is called a <em>common divisor</em> of `a` and `b` if `d \mid a` and `d \mid b`.</p>
        <p>The <em>greatest common divisor</em> of integers `a` and `b`, denoted `\gcd(a, b)`, is a positive integer `d` such that `d` is a common divisor of `a` and `b` and if `d'` is any other common divisor of `a` and `b`, then `d' \mid d`. We say that two integers `a` and `b` are <em>relatively prime</em> if `\gcd(a, b) = 1`.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="theorem">
        <div class="theorem-title">Theorem 2.2.3 (Greatest Common Divisor Linear Combination)</div>
        <p>Let `a` and `b` be nonzero integers. Then there exist integers `r` and `s` such that</p>
        <p>\[ \gcd(a, b) = ar + bs \]</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is unique.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Again, the greatest common divisor linear combination theorem can be proven using the well-ordering principle on the set
        `\{am + bn \mid m,n \in \mathbb{Z},\; am + bn > 0\}`, but this proof is non-constructive. Typically, the Euclidean algorithm is used to construct these values, as is demonstrated in the next example.</p>

    <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title">Example 2.2.4 (Euclidean Algorithm)</div>
        <p>Write the greatest common divisor of `a = 945` and `b = 2415` as a linear combination of `a` and `b`.</p>
        <p>The Euclidean algorithm begins by finding `\gcd(a, b)`, which is accomplished by repeated use of the division algorithm:</p>
        <pre>
2415 = 945 路 2 + 525
945  = 525 路 1 + 420
525  = 420 路 1 + 105
420  = 105 路 4 + 0
        </pre>
        <p>Therefore, `\gcd(2415, 945) = 105`.</p>
        <p>Next we can use the equations above to express `105` as a linear combination of `a` and `b`, working backward. We start at the second to last line:</p>
        <p>`105 = 525 - 420`</p>
        <p>`= 525 - (945 - 525) = 2 \cdot 525 - 945`</p>
        <p>`= 2 \cdot (2415 - 2 \cdot 945) - 945 = 2 \cdot 2415 - 5 \cdot 945`</p>
        <p>Therefore, `105 = 2a - 5b`.</p>
