        <p>
            Let `a` and `b` be integers. If `b = ak` for some integer
            `k`, we write `a \mid b`. An integer `d` is called a <em>common divisor</em>
            of `a` and `b` if `d \mid a` and `d \mid b`.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>greatest common divisor</em> of integers `a` and
            `b`, denoted `\gcd(a, b)`, is a positive integer `d` such
            that `d` is a common divisor of `a` and `b` and if `d'` is
            any other common divisor of `a` and `b`, then `d' \mid
            d`. We say that two integers `a` and `b` are <bu>relatively prime</bu>
            if `\gcd(a, b) = 1`.
        </p>
    </def>

    <thm num="2.2.3" name ="Greatest Common Divisor Linear Combination">
        <p>Let `a` and `b` be nonzero integers. Then there exist integers `r` and `s` such that</p>
        <p>\[ \gcd(a, b) = ar + bs \]</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is unique.</p>
    </thm>

    <p>Again, the greatest common divisor linear combination theorem can be proven using the well-ordering principle on the set
        `\{am + bn \mid m,n \in \mathbb{Z},\; am + bn > 0\}`, but this proof is non-constructive. Typically, the Euclidean algorithm is used to construct these values, as is demonstrated in the next example.</p>

    <ex num="2.2.4" name="Eucliden Algorithm">
        <p>
            Write the greatest common divisor of `a = 945` and `b = 2415` as a
            linear combination of `a` and `b`.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Euclidean algorithm begins by finding `\gcd(a, b)`, which is
            accomplished by repeated use of the division algorithm:
        </p>
        
        <align>
            2415 &= 945 \cdot 2 + 525 \\
            945  &= 525 \cdot 1 + 420 \\
            525  &= 420 \cdot 1 + 105 \\
            420  &= 105 \cdot 4 + 0  \\
        </align>
        
        <p>Therefore, `\gcd(2415, 945) = 105`.</p>

        <p>
            Next we can use the equations above to express `105` as a linear
            combination of `a` and `b`, working backward. We start at the second
            to last line:
        </p>
        <align>
            105 &= 525 - 420 \\
            &= 525 - (945 - 525) \\
            &= 2 \cdot 525 - 945 \\
            &= 2 \cdot (2415 - 2 \cdot 945) - 945 \\
            &= 2 \cdot 2415 - 5 \cdot 945 \\
        </align>
            
        <p>Therefore, `105 = 2a - 5b`.</p>
