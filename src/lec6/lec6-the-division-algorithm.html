        <h2>2.2. The Division Algorithm</h2>

        <div class="theorem">
            <h3>Theorem 2.2.1 (The Division Algorithm)</h3>
            <p>If `a, b \in \mathbb{Z}` and if `b > 0`, then there are unique integers `q` and `r` such that</p>
            <p>\[ a = qb + r \]</p>
            <p>where</p>
            <p>\[ 0 \le r < b \]</p>
        </div>

        <p><b>Proof.</b>
            Let `S = \{a - bk \mid k \in \mathbb{Z},\; a - bk \ge 0\}`,
            which is a subset of the natural numbers. If `a \ge 0`, then `a
            - b \cdot 0 \in S`. If `a < 0`, then `a - b(2a) = a(1- 2b) \ge
            0`, so `a - b(2a) \in S`. In either case, `S` is not empty. By
            the well-ordering principle, there is a minimal element of `S`,
            call it `r`. Let `q` be an integer for which `r = a - bq`.
        </p>

        <p>
            We claim that `0 \le r < b`. By definition of `S`, it must be
            that `r \ge 0`. <br> Consider the number `a - b(q + 1)`, which is
            smaller than `r`. Since `r` is minimal in `S`, we conclude
            that `a - b(q + 1) < 0`, which implies that

            \[ r - b < 0 \quad \text{or} \quad r < b.  \]

            Therefore, there exist integers `q` and `r` such that `a = bq
            + r` and `0 \le r < b`.
        </p>

        <p>
            To show that these numbers are unique, suppose that

            \[ a = bq + r \quad \text{and} \quad a = bq' + r', \]

            with `0 \le r, r' < b`. Without loss of generality, assume
            that `r' \ge r`. Then,

            \[ bq + r = bq' + r' \quad \Rightarrow \quad b(q - q') = r' -
            r \ge 0. \]
            
            Thus, `b` divides `r' - r` and since `r' - r < b` the only
            possibility is `r' - r = 0`, so `r' = r` and consequently `q =
            q'`.
