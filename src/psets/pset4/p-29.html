    <b> Projective Real Line </b><br/>
    <p>
        Define a relation on `{\mathbb R}^2 \setminus \{ (0,0) \}` by
        letting `(x_1, y_1) \sim (x_2, y_2)` if there exists a nonzero
        real number `\lambda` such that `(x_1, y_1) = ( \lambda x_2,
        \lambda y_2)`.

        Prove that `\sim` defines an equivalence relation on `{\mathbb
        R}^2 \setminus (0,0)`.

        What are the corresponding equivalence classes?

        This equivalence relation defines the projective line, denoted
        by `{\mathbb P}({\mathbb R})`, which is very important in
        geometry.
