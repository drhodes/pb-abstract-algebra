<hw2 prob="17">

  Which of the following relations define a mapping? In each case,
  supply a reason why is or is not a mapping.
  <align>
    f(p/q) &= \frac{p + 1}{p - 2} \tag{a} \\[1em]
    f(p/q) &= \frac{3p}{3q} \tag{b} \\[1em]
    f(p/q) &= \frac{p + q}{q^2} \tag{c} \\[1em]
    f(p/q) &= \frac{3p^2}{7q^2} - \frac{p}{q} \tag{d} 
  </align>
