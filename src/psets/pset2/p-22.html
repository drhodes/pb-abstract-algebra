    Let `f : A \to B` and `g : B \to C`
  </p>

  <p>
    a) If `f` and `g` are both one-to-one functions, show that `g \circ f` is one-to-one. <br>
    b) If `g \circ f` is onto, show that `g` is onto. <br>  
    c) If `g \circ f` one-to-one, show that `f` is one-to-one. <br>
    d) If `g \circ f` one-to-one and `f` is onto, show that `g` is one-to-one. <br>
    e) If `g \circ f` onto and `g` is one-to-one, show that `f` is onto. <br>
