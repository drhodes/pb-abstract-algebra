            A <em>partition</em> `P` of a set `X` is a collection of nonempty subsets 
            `X_1, X_2, \dots` such that for `i \neq j`, `X_i \cap X_j = \emptyset` and

        <h3>Theorem 1.2.35</h3>
        <p>
            Given an equivalence relation `\sim` on a set `X`, the equivalence classes of `X` 
            form a partition of `X`. Conversely, if 
            `P = \{X_k\}` is a partition of a set `X`, then there exists an equivalence relation on `X` 
            whose equivalence classes are exactly the subsets `X_k`.
        </p>
        <h4>Proof</h4>
        <p>
            Suppose `\sim` is an equivalence relation on `X`. For any `x \in X`, the class `[x]` is 
            nonempty because `x \in [x]` (by reflexivity). Also,
        </p>
        <p class="display-math">
            \[
            \bigcup_{x \in X} [x] = X
            \]
        </p>
        <p>
            since every `x \in X` belongs to its equivalence class. Finally, if 
            `[x] \cap [y] \neq \emptyset`, then there exists an element `z` such that `z \in [x]` and 
            `z \in [y]`. Then `z \sim x` and `z \sim y`. By symmetry, `x \sim z`, and by transitivity, 
            `x \sim y`; hence, `[x] = [y]`. Thus, the equivalence classes form a partition of `X`.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conversely, if `P` is a partition of `X`, define a relation on `X` by declaring 
            `x \sim y` if and only if `x` and `y` belong to the same subset in `P`. This relation is 
            clearly an equivalence relation, and its equivalence classes are exactly the subsets of `P`.

            Two equivalence classes of an equivalence relation are either disjoint or equal.
