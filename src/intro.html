        <h1>1.1 What is Abstract Algebra?</h1>
        <p>
            <p>Abstract algebra is the subject area of mathematics that studies algebraic structures, such as groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, and algebras. This course is an introduction to abstract algebra. We will spend most of our time studying groups. Group theory is the study of symmetry, and is one of the most beautiful areas in all of mathematics. It arises in puzzles, visual arts, music, nature, the physical and life sciences, computer science, cryptography, and of course, throughout mathematics. This book covers the basic concepts of group theory, and a special effort will be made to emphasize the intuition behind the concepts and motivate the subject matter. In the final chapter, we will also introduce rings and fields.</p>
            <p>Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry.Bertrand Russell, philosopher &amp; mathematician</p>

        <h1>What Should You Expect?</h1>
        <p>Up to this point, it is possible that your experience of
            mathematics has been about using formulas and
            algorithms. You are used to being asked to do things like:
            "solve for x", "take the derivative of this function",
            "integrate this function", etc. Accomplishing tasks like
            these usually amounts to mimicking examples that you have
            seen in class or in your textbook. However, this is only one
            part of mathematics. Mathematicians experiment, make
            conjectures, write definitions, and prove theorems. While
            engaging with the material contained in this book, we will
            learn about doing all of these things, especially writing
            proofs. Mathematicians are in the business of proving
            theorems and this is exactly our endeavor. Ultimately, the
            focus of this book is on producing and discovering
            mathematics.  Your progress will be fueled by your ability
            to wrestle with mathematical ideas and to prove theorems. As
            you work through the book, you will find that you have ideas
            for proofs, but you are unsure of them. Do not be afraid to
            tinker and make mistakes. You can always revisit your work
            as you become more proficient. Do not expect to do most
            things perfectly on your first—or even second or
            third—attempt. The material is too rich for a human being to
            completely understand immediately. Learning a new skill
            requires dedication and patience during periods of
            frustration. Moreover, solving genuine problems is difficult
            and takes time. But it is also rewarding!  You may encounter
            many defeats, but you must not be defeated.Maya Angelou,
            poet & activist</p>

    <page title="An Inquiry-Based Approach" path="introduction/section3">

        <p>In many mathematics classrooms, "doing mathematics" means
            following the rules dictated by the teacher, and "knowing mathematics"
            means remembering and applying them. However, this is not a typical
            mathematics textbook and is likely a significant departure from your
            prior experience, where mimicking prefabricated examples led you to
            success. In order to promote a more active participation in your
            learning, this book adheres to an educational philosophy called
            inquiry-based learning (IBL). IBL is a student-centered method of
            teaching that engages students in sense-making activities and
            challenges them to create or discover mathematics. In this book, you
            will be expected to actively engage with the topics at hand and to
            construct your own understanding. You will be given tasks requiring
            you to solve problems, conjecture, experiment, explore, create, and
            communicate. Rather than showing facts or a clear, smooth path to a
            solution, this book will guide and mentor you through an adventure in
            mathematical discovery.  This book makes no assumptions about the
            specifics of how your instructor chooses to implement an IBL
            approach. Generally speaking, students are told which problems and
            theorems to grapple with for the next class sessions, and then the
            majority of class time is devoted to students working in groups on
            unresolved solutions/proofs or having students present their proposed
            solutions/proofs to the rest of the class. Students should—as much as
            possible—be responsible for guiding the acquisition of knowledge and
            validating the ideas presented. That is, you should not be looking to
            the instructor as the sole authority. In an IBL course, instructor and
            students have joint responsibility for the depth and progress of the
            course. While effective IBL courses come in a variety of forms, they
            all possess a few essential ingredients. According
            to https://www.colorado.edu/eer/sites/default/files/attached-files/laursenrasmussencommentaryauthorversion0219.pdfLaursen
            and Rasmussen (2019), the Four Pillars of IBL are:</p>
        <ul path="introduction/section3.I1">
            <li> Students engage deeply with coherent and meaningful mathematical tasks. </li>
            <li> Students collaboratively process mathematical ideas. </li>
            <li>Instructors inquire into student thinking.</li>
            <li>Instructors foster equity in their design and facilitation choices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This book can only address the first pillar while it is the responsibility of your instructor and class to develop a culture that provides an adequate environment for the remaining pillars to take root. If you are studying this material independent of a classroom setting, I encourage you to find a community where you can collaborate and discuss your ideas.
            Just like learning to play an instrument or sport, you will have to learn new skills and ideas. Along this journey, you should expect a cycle of victory and defeat, experiencing a full range of emotions. Sometimes you will feel exhilarated, other times you might be seemingly paralyzed by extreme confusion. You will experience struggle and failure before you experience understanding. This is part of the normal learning process. If you are doing things well, you should be confused on a regular basis. Productive struggle and mistakes provide opportunities for growth. As the author of this text, I am here to guide and challenge you, but I cannot do the learning for you, just as a music teacher cannot move your fingers and your heart for you. This is a very exciting time in your mathematical career. You will experience mathematics in a new and profound way. Be patient with yourself and others as you adjust to a new paradigm.
            You could view this book as mountaineering guidebook. I have provided a list of mountains to summit, sometimes indicating which trailhead to start at or which trail to follow. There will always be multiple routes to top, some more challenging than others. Some summits you will attain quickly and easily, others might require a multi-day expedition. Oftentimes, your journey will be laced with false summits. Some summits will be obscured by clouds. Sometimes you will have to wait out a storm, perhaps turning around and attempting another route, or even attempting to summit on a different day after the weather has cleared. The strength, fitness, and endurance you gain along the way will allow you to take on more and more challenging, and often beautiful, terrain. Do not forget to take in the view from the top! The joy you feel from overcoming obstacles and reaching each summit under your own will and power has the potential to be life changing. But make no mistake, the journey is vastly more important than the destinations.

    <page title="Structure of the Textbook" path="introduction/section4">
        <p>As you read this book, you will be required to digest the
            material in a meaningful way. It is your responsibility to
            read and understand new definitions and their related
            concepts. In addition, you will be asked to complete problems
            aimed at solidifying your understanding of the material. Most
            importantly, you will be asked to make conjectures, produce
            counterexamples, and prove theorems. All of these tasks will
            almost always be challenging.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The items labeled as <b>Definition</b> and <b>Example</b>
            are meant to be read and digested. However, the items
            labeled as <b>Problem</b>, <b>Theorem</b>,
            and <b>Corollary</b> require action on your part. Items
            labeled as <b>Problem</b> are sort of a mixed bag. Some
            Problems are computational in nature and aimed at improving
            your understanding of a particular concept while others ask
            you to provide a counterexample for a statement if it is
            false or to provide a proof if the statement is true. Items
            with the <b>Theorem</b> and <b>Corollary</b> designation are
            mathematical facts and the intention is for you to produce a
            valid proof of the given statement. The main difference
            between a theorem and a corollary is that corollaries are
            typically statements that follow quickly from a previous
            theorem. In general, you should expect corollaries to have
            very short proofs. However, that does not mean that you
            cannot produce a more lengthy yet valid proof of a
            corollary.
        </p>
        <p>Oftentimes, the problems and theorems are guiding you towards a substantial, more general result. Other times, they are designed to get you to apply ideas in a new way. One thing to always keep in mind is that every task in this book can be done by you, the student. But it may not be on your first try, or even your second.
        </p>
        <p>Discussion of new topics is typically kept at a minimum and there are very few examples in this book. This is intentional. One of the objectives of the items labeled as <b>Problem</b> is for you to produce the examples needed to internalize unfamiliar concepts. The overarching goal of this book is to help you develop a deep and meaningful understanding of the processes of producing mathematics by putting you in direct contact with mathematical phenomena.</p>
        <p>Don’t just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?Paul Halmos, mathematician</p>
