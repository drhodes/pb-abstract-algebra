                We will now prove some very important properties about all
                groups. When working with generic groups, multiplicative
                structure is used almost always. For example, we will denote
                `{g\circ h}` in `{G}` simply as `{gh}` and the inverse of `{g}`
                as `{g^{-1}}`. Also, we will use exponential notation to
                represent iterated products: `{g^n = \underbrace{g\cdot g\cdots
                g}_{n\text{ times}}}` and `{g^{-n} = \underbrace{g^{-1}\cdot
                g^{-1}\cdots g^{-1}}_{n\text{ times}}}`. Although we will
                primarily use `{e}` for the identity of `{G}`, we might
                sometimes use `{1\in G}` as the identity element. In fact, we
                are justified in saying "the" identity element because it is
                unique.

            <prop num="3.2.18">
                The identity element in a group `{G}` is
                unique; that is, there exists only one element `{e\in G}` such that
                `{eg=ge=g}` for all `{g\in G}`.
            </prop>

            <proof>
                Let `{e'}` and `{e''\in G}` such that `{ge' = e'g = g}` and
                `{ge'' = e''g = g}` for all `{g\in G}`. Then
                \[ e' = e'e'' = e''. \]
            </proof>

            <p>
                Likewise, we can say "the" inverse of `{g\in G}` since inverses are also unique.
            </p>

            <prop num="3.2.19"> If `{g}` is any element in a group `{G}`, then the
                inverse of `{g}` is unique.

                Let `{g'}` and `{g''\in G}` such that
                \[ gg' = g'g = e \quad\text{and}\quad gg'' = g''g = e. \]

            <proof>
                Since inverses are unique in groups, as shown above, it
                suffices to show that `{h^{-1}g^{-1}}` acts like an inverse to `{gh}`. Note that

                \[ (h^{-1}g^{-1})(gh) = e. \]
                Therefore, `{h^{-1}g^{-1}}` is the inverse of `{gh}`.

            <prop num="3.2.22" name="Cancellation Laws">
                If `{G}` is a group and `{a,b,c\in G}`, then `{ba=ca}`
                implies `{b=c}` and `{ab=ac}` implies `{b=c}`.
            </prop>

            <proof>
                We will prove the case that `{ab=ac}` implies that `{b=c}`.
                Multiplying both sides of the equation on the left by `{a^{-1}}`
                then gives

                \[ a^{-1}(ab)=a^{-1}(ac) \quad\Rightarrow\quad

                eb=ec \quad\Rightarrow\quad b=c.
                \]

                The case of `{ba=ca}` is handled similarly.

            <p>
                This proposition tells us that the <term>right-</term> and
                <term>left-cancellation</term>
                laws are true in all groups. In fact, the above proof used all
                three axioms of group theory: associativity, identity, and
                inverses, to prove the cancellation laws. In some regard, any
                algebraic object with cancellation must be group-like.
            </p>


            <prop num="3.2.23">
                Let `{G}` be a group and `{a,b\in G}`. Then the equations
                `{ax=b}` and `{xa=b}` have unique solutions in `{G}`.
            </prop>

            <proof>
                We will prove the case that `{ax=b}` has a unique solution in
                `{G}`. Note that `{x=a^{-1}b}` is a solution to the equation
                since \[ a(a^{-1}b) = (aa^{-1})b = eb = b. \] This shows the
                existence of a solution. For uniqueness, if `{x}` and `{y}` are
                both solutions to the above equation, then `{ax=b=ay}`.
                Canceling `{a}` on the left gives `{x=y}`. Thus, `{ax=b}` has a
                unique solution in `{G}`. The case of `{xa=b}` is handled
                similarly.
            </proof>

            <p>
                Again, we should emphasize that in the above proof we used all three axioms of group
                theory to solve equations. Groups are exactly the setting where we solve equations in
                the manner we first learned in algebra class.

                <p>
                    In a group `{G}`, the usual exponent laws hold; that is, for
                    all `{g,h\in G}` and `{m,n\in\mathbb{Z}}`:
                </p>
            </prop>

            <align>
                g^m g^n &= g^{m+n} \tag{a} \\
                (g^m)^n &= g^{mn} \tag{b} \\
                (gh)^n &= (h^{-1}g^{-1})^{-n} \tag{c}
            </align>

            <p>
                Furthermore, if `{G}` is Abelian, then `{(gh)^n = g^n h^n}`.
            </p>

            <p>
                The proof of the above exponent laws follows from the associativity of the group and a
                (double) induction argument. It should be emphasized that, in general,
                `{(gh)^n \neq g^n h^n}` in groups and commutativity in some form is needed for equality.
            </p>

            <p>
                In fact, when a group is Abelian, additive notation is often
                used instead of multiplicative notation. For example, we will
                denote `{g\circ h}` in `{G}` simply as `{g+h}` and the inverse
                of `{g}` as `{-g}`. Also, we will use additive notation to
                represent iterated sums:

                \[ ng = \underbrace{g+g+\cdots+g}_{n\text{ times}} \]

                and

                \[ -ng = \underbrace{-g+(-g)+\cdots+(-g)}_{n\text{ times}}. \]

                Although we will primarily use `{e}` for the identity of `{G}`,
                we might sometimes use `{0\in G}` as the identity element. The
                three "exponent laws" look like distributive laws for additive
                groups: for `{g,h\in G}` and `{m,n\in\mathbb{Z}}`, we have

                mg+ng &= (m+n)g \tag{a} \\
                m(ng) &= (mn)g \tag{b} \\
                m(g+h) &= mg+mh \tag{c} \\
