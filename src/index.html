        <p>
            Welcome, this is a creative commons remix of the lecture
            series offered by Dr. Andrew Misseldine at Southern Utah
            University for the course "Math 4220 - Abstract Algebra I"
            which was recorded during covid in 2020.
        </p>

        <todo>
            Contact Andrew for more info about how and why this course
            was hosted on youtube and possibly any pushback
        </todo>
        
        <p>           
            Although the educators listed below have geneously
            released much of the content of the course under open
            licenses, it should be explicitly stated that they are not
            affiliated with this remix .. yet!  (maybe we can harang
            them into participating!)
        </p>
        
        <p>              
            Finally, kind reader, please note that any errors you find
            may have very well been introduced by me (programmer), so
            if you find a mistake and feel compelled to share, please
            leave a comment at the bottom of the page where you found
            the mistake. Alternatively, you could submit an issue over
            on github or even send a pull request.

                I'm building the online version of this course to
                learn abstract algbera using Lean4/mathlib with the
                hopes that others will find this remix helpful.
