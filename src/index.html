            Welcome, this is a creative commons remix of the lecture
            series recorded during by Dr. Andrew Misseldine at
            Southern Utah University for the undergraduate course
            "Math 4220 - Abstract Algebra I".

        <p>           
            Although the educators listed below have geneously
            released much of the content of the course under open
            licenses, it should be explicitly stated that they are not
            affiliated with this remix.
        </p>

            Finally, kind reader, please note that any errors you find
            may have very well been introduced by me (programmer), so
            if you find a mistake and feel compelled to share, please
            leave a comment at the bottom of the page where you found
            the mistake. Alternatively, you could submit an issue over
            on github or even send a pull request.
        </p>

                Tom Judson's Abstract Algebra: Theory and
                Applications is an open source textbook designed
                to teach the principles and theory of abstract
                algebra to college juniors and seniors in a
                rigorous manner. Its strengths include a wide
                range of exercises, both computational and
                theoretical, plus many nontrivial
                applications. Rob Beezer has contributed
                complementary material using the open source
                system, Sage.
                <br/><br/>
                The first half of the book presents group theory,
                through the Sylow theorems, with enough material
                for a semester-long course. The second-half is
                suitable for a second semester and presents rings,
                integral domains, Boolean algebras, vector spaces,
                and fields, concluding with Galois Theory.

                I'm building the online version of this course to
                learn abstract algbera using Lean4/mathlib with the
                hopes that others will find this remix helpful.
