      Consider the mapping `f : A \to A`, with `A \neq \varnothing`, defined
      by the rule `f(a) = a` for all `a \in A`. This mapping is known as the
      identity function, is denoted `\operatorname{id}_A`, and is always
      bijective.

    <def num="1.2.23" name="invertible">
      Let `f : A \to B` be a function. We say that `f` is
      <term>invertible</term> if there exists a function `f^{-1} : B \to A`,
      called the <term>inverse</term> of `f`, such that


      \[ f^{-1} \circ f = \text{id}_A\quad \text{and}\quad f \circ f^{-1} = \text{id}_B. \]

      <p>When an inverse exists, it is unique. We will see that this is a property true for all groups.</p>

        The functions `f(x) = x^3` and `g(x) = e^x` are invertible, real-valued functions since
        `f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}` and `g^{-1}(x) = \ln x`. Note that
        `f^{-1} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}` and `g^{-1} : (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}`.
      </p>

        On the other hand, the function
        `h_1 : \mathbb{R} \to [0,\infty)` given by `h_1(x) = x^2` is <b>NOT</b> invertible. It is tempting to
        believe that
        `h_1^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x}`, but this is where the domain/codomain conventions of calculus can be ambiguous.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that although `\sqrt{x^2} = x` for all `x \ge 0`, we have
        `\sqrt{x^2} = |x|`, which does not equal `x` for `x < 0`. On the other hand, the mapping `h_2 : [0,\infty) \to
          [0,\infty)` given by `h_2(x)=x^2` is invertible with `h_2^{-1}(x)=\sqrt{x}`. It is important to recognize that
          as functions `h_1 \neq h_2` even though they are defined by the same mathematical formula. </p>

      I couldn't find a definition in Mathlib for plain old inverse, but MoP
      <a href="https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/08_Functions.html#id24">has
        one</a>. Mathlib does have definitions for left and right inverses, so
      I've reused those. Inverses with restricted domains uses different
      definitions as shown below.

      It's worth mentioning the naming convention for the Interval type with the
      three letter name prefixed with "I" as seen below.
    </p>

    <todo> build a lecture outlining how the family of intervals (Ixy) work. </todo>
