    <h3>1.2. Sets and Equivalence Relations</h3>

    <p><strong>Example 1.2.22.</strong> Consider the mapping 
        `f : A \to A`, with `A \neq \varnothing`, defined by the rule 
        `f(a) = a` for all `a \in A`. This mapping is known as the identity function, is denoted 
        `\operatorname{id}_A`, and is always bijective.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Definition 1.2.23.</strong> Let 
        `f : A \to B` be a function. We say that `f` is invertible if there exists a function 
        `f^{-1} : B \to A`, called the inverse of `f`, such that
    </p>

    <p class="center">
        `f^{-1} \circ f = \operatorname{id}_A` and `f \circ f^{-1} = \operatorname{id}_B`.
    </p>

    <p>When an inverse exists, it is unique. We will see that this is a property true for all groups.</p>

    <p><strong>Example 1.2.24.</strong> The functions 
        `f(x) = x^3` and `g(x) = e^x` are invertible, real-valued functions since 
        `f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}` and `g^{-1}(x) = \ln x`. Note that 
        `f^{-1} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}` and `g^{-1} : (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}`.
    </p>

    <p>On the other hand, the function 
        `h_1 : \mathbb{R} \to [0,\infty)` given by `h_1(x) = x^2` is <strong>NOT</strong> invertible. It is tempting to believe that 
        `h_1^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x}`, but this is where the domain/codomain conventions of calculus can be ambiguous.
    </p>

    <p>Note that although 
        `\sqrt{x^2} = x` for all `x \ge 0`, we have 
        `\sqrt{x^2} = |x|`, which does not equal `x` for `x < 0`. On the other hand, the mapping 
        `h_2 : [0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)` given by `h_2(x) = x^2` is invertible with 
        `h_2^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x}`.
        It is important to recognize that as functions `h_1 \neq h_2` even though they are defined by the same mathematical formula.
    </p>

        <p> I couldn't find a definition in Mathlib for plain old inverse, but MoP
            <a href="https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/08_Functions.html#id24">has one</a>. Mathlib
            does have definitions for left and right inverse, so I've
            used those instead of using composition. In cases with
            restricted domains there are other definitions.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's worth mentioning the naming convention for the
            Interval type with the three letter name prefixed with "I"
            as seen below.
