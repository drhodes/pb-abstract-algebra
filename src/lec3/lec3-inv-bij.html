        <strong>Theorem 1.2.25.</strong> A mapping is invertible if and only if it is both one-to-one and onto.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Proof.</strong>

        Let `f : A \to B`. If `f` is bijective, then for each `b \in
        B` there is a unique `a \in A` such that `f(a) = b`. Define a
        mapping `g : B \to A` such that `g(b) = a` exactly when `f(a)
        = b`. By the uniqueness mentioned above, `g` is
        well-defined. Next, note that `f \circ g =
        \operatorname{id}_B` and `g \circ f =
        \operatorname{id}_A`. Therefore, `f` is invertible.
    </p>

    <p>If `f` is invertible, then 
        `f \circ f^{-1} = \operatorname{id}_B`, which is a surjective map. By exercise 1.3.22 (b), `f` is surjective. Likewise, 
        `f^{-1} \circ f = \operatorname{id}_A`, which is an injective map. By exercise 1.3.22 (c), `f` is injective. Therefore, `f` is bijective.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Example 1.2.26.</strong> Let `A` be an `m \times n` matrix. Then this matrix naturally produces a linear transformation 
        `T : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m` using the rule
    </p>

    <p class="center">
        `T(x) = Ax`.
    </p>

        As was learned in Linear Algebra class, an `n \times n` matrix
        `A` is invertible (i.e., it has an inverse `A^{-1}`) if and only
        if `A` is nonsingular, that is, `Ax = b` has a unique
        solution. Notice that this statement is a special case of the
        previous theorem. We note that `A` being nonsingular is the same
        thing as `T` being bijective. Note that `Ax = b` having a solution
        means that `b` is the \text{Im}[x]age of some vector `x` via `T`, that is,
        `T(x) = b`. This is surjectivity. Likewise, since `Ax = b` has a
        unique solution means there is exactly one vector `x` such that
        `Ax = b`. Thus, there is only one vector `x` such that `T(x) =
        b`. This is injectivity.
