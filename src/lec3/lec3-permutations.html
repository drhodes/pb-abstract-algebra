    <p><strong>Definition 1.2.27.</strong> For any set `X`, a bijective mapping
        `\pi : X \to X` is called a <em>permutation</em> of `X`. The set of
        permutations on `X` is denoted `S_X`. When the set has the form `X = \{1, 2,
        \ldots, n\} \subset \mathbb{N}`, we denote the permutation set as `S_n`.
    </p>

    <p>
        When working with permutations on a finite set `X`, it can be convenient
        to use a two-row tableaux to express the permutation, where the first
        row is an arrangement of the elements of `X` and the second row is the
        images of the first row with respect to `\pi`. Thus, the second row will
        be a rearrangement of the elements of `X`, which is why these maps are
        called permutations. For example, the permutation `\pi : X \to X` where
        `X = \{1, \ldots, n\}` might have the form
    </p>

    <p class="center">
        \[ \pi = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & \cdots & n \\ \pi(1) & \pi(2) & \cdots & \pi(n) \end{pmatrix}. \]
    </p>

    <thm num="1.2.28" name="Cardinality of Permutations">
        Let `X` be a finite, nonempty set. Then `|S_X| = |X|!`.
    </thm>

    <p><strong>Proof.</strong> Without loss of generality, we may
        assume that `X = \{1, \ldots, n\}`, where `n = |X|`. Let `\pi
        : X \to X` be a permutation. Then there are `n` choices for
        the assignment `\pi(1)` since `1` can be mapped to any element
        of `X`. Likewise, there are `n-1` choices for the assignment
        `\pi(2)` since `2` can be mapped to any element of `X` other
        than `\pi(1)` (to guarantee that `\pi` is
        injective). Likewise, there are `n-3` choices for `\pi(3)`,
        since it can be any element of `X` except `\pi(1)` and
        `\pi(2)`. Continuing in this pattern, there will always be `n
        - k + 1` choices for `\pi(k)`. Finally, the product of these
        choices will give us the correct number of permutations which
        is `n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdots 1 = n!`.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Example 1.2.29.</strong> Suppose that `X = \{1, 2, 3\}`. Define a map
        `\pi : X \to X` by
    </p>


    \[ \pi(1) = 2,\quad \pi(2) = 1,\quad \pi(3) = 3. \]

    <p>
        This is a bijective map and hence a permutation. In particular,
        \[
        \pi
        = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \pi(1) & \pi(2) & \pi(3) \end{pmatrix}
        = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 1 & 3 \end{pmatrix}.
        \]
    </p>

    <p>There are five other elements of `S_3`:</p>

    <ul>
        \[ \operatorname{id}_X = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix},
        \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 3 & 2 \end{pmatrix},
        \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 3 & 1 \end{pmatrix},
        \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 1 & 3 \end{pmatrix},
        \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 3 & 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix},
        \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 3 & 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix} \]
    </ul>

    <p>
        It is always possible to compose two permutations since they have the
        same domains as codomains, and this composite will itself be a
        permutation. A three-row tableaux can be used to compute their
        composite. The right two rows will be the same as the permutation on the
        right, but the third row will be the image of this second row by the
        permutation on the left. For example,
    </p>

    \[
    \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 3 & 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \circ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 1 & 3 \end{pmatrix}
    = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 1 & 3 \\ 2 & 3 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
    = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 3 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
    \]

    <p>
        Permutations always have inverses since they are
        bijective. They can be easily constructed by reflecting the
        above permutation tableaux (and reordering the elements, if
        necessary). For example, `\pi^{-1} : X \to X` is given as
    </p>

    \[ \pi^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} \pi(1) & \pi(2) & \pi(3) \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}
    = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 3 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}
    = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 1 & 3 \end{pmatrix} = \pi. \]

    <p>Interestingly enough, this permutation is equal to its own inverse, although this is not always the case.</p>
