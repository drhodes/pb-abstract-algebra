            The function of education is to teach one to think
            intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus
            character – that is the goal of true education.

        <h2>1.2. Sets and Equivalence Relations</h2>

        <h3>Definition 1.2.12</h3>
        <p>
            Given sets `A` and `B`, we can define a new set 
            `A \times B`, called the Cartesian product of `A` and `B`, as a set of ordered pairs. That is,
        </p>
        <p class="formula">
            \[ A \times B = \{ (a, b) \mid a \in A \text{ and } b \in B \}. \]
        </p>
        <p>
            We define the Cartesian product of `n` sets to be
        </p>
        <p class="formula">
            \[\prod_{i=1}^{n} A_i = A_1 \times \dots \times A_n = \{ (a_1, \dots, a_n) \mid a_i \in A_i \text{ for } i = 1, \dots, n \}.\]
        </p>
        <p>
            If `A = A_1 = A_2 = \dots = A_n`, we often write `A^n` for
            `A \times \dots \times A` (with `A` written `n`
            times). For example, the set `\mathbb{R}^3` consists of
            all 3‑tuples of real numbers.
        </p>

        <h4>Example 1.2.13</h4>
        <p>
            If `A = \{x, y\}`, `B = \{1, 2, 3\}`, and `C = \varnothing`, then 
            `A \times B` is the set
            
            \[A \times B = \{ (x, 1), (x, 2), (x, 3), (y, 1), (y, 2), (y, 3) \} \quad \text{and} \quad A \times C = \varnothing.\]
        </p>

    <page title="Relations" path="lecture2/relations">
        <h3>Definition 1.2.14</h3>
        <p>
            A relation `R` between the sets `A` and `B` is a subset of their Cartesian product, that is, 
            `R \subseteq A \times B`. For elements `a \in A` and `b \in B`, we say that 
            `a` is related to `b` with respect to `R`, denoted `a R b`, if and only if 
            `(a, b) \in R`.
        </p>
        <p>
            We say that a relation `f \subseteq A \times B` is a <strong>function</strong> or mapping from set `A` to set `B`, denoted 
            `f: A \to B` or 
            \[A \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B,\]
            if each element `a \in A` occurs in exactly one ordered pair of the form `(a, b)` in `f`; that is, each `a \in A`
            is related to exactly one `b \in B`. This unique element `b` is called the <strong>image</strong> of `a` with respect to `f`, and this
            unique relationship is expressed as `f(a) = b` or `f: a \mapsto b`. The set `A` is called the <strong>domain</strong> of `f`, the set `B` is called the <strong>codomain</strong> of `f`, and the set
        </p>
        
        <p class="formula"> \[f(A) = \{ f(a) \mid a \in A \}\] </p>
        
        <p>
            is called the <strong>image</strong> (or range) of `f`. For any subset `X \subseteq B`, the set
        </p>
        <p class="formula">
            \[f^{-1}(X) = \{ a \in A \mid f(a) \in X \}\]
        </p>
        <p>
            is called the <strong>pre-image</strong> of `X` with respect to `f`.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let `B^A` denote the set of all functions of the form `f: A \to B`. This notation is used because if `|A| = a`
            and `|B| = b`, then `|B^A| = b^a`, where `|S|` denotes the cardinality of the set `S`.
        </p>

        <h4>Example 1.2.15</h4>
        <p>
            In calculus, functions between real numbers are often defined using formulas such as `f(x) = x^3` or `g(x) = e^x`. Such function expressions are to be understood as meaning the mapping 
            `f: x \mapsto f(x)` is given by substitution—for example, `f(2) = 2^3 = 8` and `g(0) = e^0 = 1`.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this context, the domain and codomain are usually not stated, but the convention is to set them as the maximal subsets of `\mathbb{R}` such that `f(x) \in \mathbb{R}` for each `x \in \text{dom } f`. For example, if 
            `f_1(x) = 1/x` and `f_2(x) = \sqrt{x}`,
        </p>
        <p>
            then `f_1(0)` and `f_2(-1)` do not evaluate to be real numbers. Therefore, the convention is to restrict the sets so that
        </p>
        
        <p class="formula">
            \[f_1: ((-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)) \to ((-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty))\]
        </p>
        <p class="formula">
            \[f_2: [0, \infty) \to [0, \infty)\]
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, the functions above have the form 
            `f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}` and `g: \mathbb{R} \to (0, \infty)`.
        </p>

        <h4>Example 1.2.16</h4>
        <p>
            Consider the relation `f: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Z}` given
            by `f(p/q) = p`. We know that

            \[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}, \]

            but is `f(\frac{1}{2}) = 1` or `2?`

            <show-hide>
                This relation cannot be a mapping because it is not
                well‑defined. A relation is well‑defined if each element
                in the domain is assigned to a unique element in the
                range. This is particularly a problem when "mappings" are
                defined on sets of equivalence classes† according to
                representatives from the classes. If not carefully
                defined, such “mappings” might not be functions.

        <h3>Definition 1.2.17</h3>
        <p>
            Given two functions `f: B \to C` and `g: A \to B`&dagger;, the <strong>composition</strong> of `f` and `g`, denoted 
            `f \circ g: A \to C`, is defined by

        <p class="formula">
            \[(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)).\]
        </p>

        <h4>Example 1.2.18</h4>
        <p>
            If `f(x) = x^3` and `g(x) = e^x`, then 
            \[(f \circ g)(x) = (e^x)^3 = e^{3x}.\]

        <h3>Definition 1.2.19</h3>
        <p>
            Let `f: A \to B` be a function. Let `a_1, a_2 \in A`. We say that `f` is <strong>injective</strong> or one‑to‑one if 
            `f(a_1) = f(a_2)` implies that `a_1 = a_2`; in other words, for each `b \in f(A)` there is a unique `a \in A` such that `f(a) = b`.
        </p>
        <p>
            We say that `f` is <strong>surjective</strong> or onto if the image of `f` equals the codomain of `f` (`f(A) = B`), or in other words, for all `b \in B` there exists an `a \in A` such that `f(a) = b`.
        </p>
        <p>
            If `f` is both injective and surjective, then we say that `f` is <strong>bijective</strong>.
        </p>

        <h4>Example 1.2.20</h4>
        <p>
            If `f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}`, `g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}`, and `h: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}` are given by 
            `f(x) = x^3`, `g(x) = e^x`, and `h(x) = x^2`, then `f` is bijective, `g` is injective but not surjective, and `h` is neither injective nor surjective. On the other hand, the mappings 
            `g_1: \mathbb{R} \to (0, \infty)` and `h_1: \mathbb{R} \to [0, \infty)` given by `g_1(x) = e^x` and `h_2(x) = x^2` are both surjective maps but only `g_1` is injective. If we consider 
            `h_2: [0, \infty) \to [0, \infty)` given by `h_2(x) = x^2`, then `h_2` is bijective. For these reasons, the convention for defining functions in calculus is very imprecise for higher mathematics.
        </p>

        <h3>Theorem 1.2.21</h3>
        <p>
            Let `f: A \to B`, `g: B \to C`, and `h: C \to D`. Then:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) The composition of mappings is associative, that is, 
                \[(h \circ g) \circ f = h \circ (g \circ f).\]
            </li>
            <li>(b) If `f` and `g` are both surjective, then `g \circ f` is surjective;
            </li>
            <li>(c) If `f` and `g` are both injective, then `g \circ f` is injective;
            </li>
            <li>(d) If `f` and `g` are both bijective, then `g \circ f` is bijective.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <proof>

            <h4>Proof</h4>
            <p>
                Let `a \in A`. Then
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                \[[(h \circ g) \circ f](a) = (h \circ g)(f(a)) = h(g(f(a))) = h((g \circ f)(a)) = [h \circ (g \circ f)](a),\]
            </p>
            <p>
                which proves (a).
            </p>
            <p>
                Let `c \in C`. Since `g` is surjective, there exists
                some `b \in B` such that `g(b) = c`. Likewise, since
                `f` is surjective, there exists some `a \in A` such
                that `f(a) = b`. Thus,
            </p>
            
            <p class="formula">
                \[(g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)) = g(b) = c,\]
            </p>
            <p>
                which proves (b). Part (c) is left as an exercise to
                the student, and part (d) follows immediately from (b)
                and (c).
