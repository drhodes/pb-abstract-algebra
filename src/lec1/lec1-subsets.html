            <b>Definition 1.2.4.</b>

            Let `A` and `B` be two sets. If `A` and `B` have exactly
			the same elements as each other, then `A = B`. If every
			element of `A` is an element of `B`, then `A` is a subset
			of `B`, denoted by `A \subseteq B`. For example, `\{1, 2\}
			\subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}`.
            
        </p>
	</div>

	<p>
        Note that it is always true that `\varnothing \subseteq A`
		for any set `A`. The reason is that there exists no
		counterexample â€“ there is no element in `\varnothing`
		which is not in `A`.
    </p>

	<p>
        If `A \subseteq B` and `A \neq B`, then `A \subset B` and `A`
		is a proper subset of `B`.
    </p>
    
	<p>
        <b>Example 1.2.5.</b>

        Consider the three sets: let `A` be the set of all even
		numbers, `B = \{2, 4, 6\}`, and `C = \{2, 3, 4,
		6\}`. Here, `B \subseteq A` since every element of `B` is
		an even number. However, `B \neq A` since `8 \in A` but `8
		\notin B`, so `B \subset A`. It is also true that `B
		\subset C`. On the other hand, `C \not\subseteq A` since
		`3 \in C` but `3 \notin A`.

        find the relevent definitions for working with
        lean subsets. Mention how the type <code> Set </code> is
        requires a shift in thinking.

        <p>
            <center-code> (X : Set R) </center-code>
        </p>

        means that <code> X </code> may be any set of real numbers,
        but only reals. It may not contains other sets of reals.

        example 1.2.5 in lean

		numbers, `B = \{2, 4, 6\}`, and `C = \{2, 3, 4,
		6\}`. Here, `B \subseteq A` since every element of `B` is
		an even number. However, `B \neq A` since `8 \in A` but `8
		\notin B`, so `B \subset A`. It is also true that `B
