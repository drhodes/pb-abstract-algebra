      Let `A` and `B` be two sets. If `A` and `B` have exactly the same elements
      as each other, then `A = B`. If every element of `A` is an element of `B`,
      then `A` is a <term>subset</term>
      of `B`, denoted by `{A \subseteq B}`. For example, `\{1, 2\} \subseteq
      \{1, 2, 3\}`.
    </def>

    <p>
      Note that it is always true that `\varnothing \subseteq A` for any set
      `A`. The reason is that there exists no counterexample â€“ there is no
      element in `\varnothing` which is not in `A`.
    </p>

    <p>
      If `A \subseteq B` and `A \neq B`, then `A \subset B` and `A` is a proper
      subset of `B`.

      Consider the three sets: let `A` be the set of all even numbers, `B = \{2,
      4, 6\}`, and `C = \{2, 3, 4, 6\}`. Here, `B \subseteq A` since every
      element of `B` is an even number. However, `B \neq A` since `8 \in A` but
      `8 \notin B`, so `B \subset A`. It is also true that `B \subset C`. On the
      other hand, `C \not\subseteq A` since `3 \in C` but `3 \notin A`.

  <todo>
    find the relevent definitions for working with lean subsets. Mention how the
    type <code> Set </code> is requires a shift in thinking.

    <p>
      <center-code> (X : Set R) </center-code>
    </p>

    means that <code> X </code> may be any set of real numbers, but only reals.
    It may not contains other sets of reals.

    example 1.2.5 in lean Consider the three sets: let `A` be the set of all
    even numbers, `B = \{2, 4, 6\}`, and `C = \{2, 3, 4, 6\}`. Here, `B
    \subseteq A` since every element of `B` is an even number. However, `B \neq
    A` since `8 \in A` but `8 \notin B`, so `B \subset A`. It is also true that
    `B \subset C`. On the other hand, `C \not\subseteq A` since `3 \in C` but `3
    \notin A`.
