		<h3>1.2. Sets and Equivalence Relations</h3>
        
		<def num="1.2.1" name="Set">
            A set is a well-defined collection of distinct
			objects. The objects of a set are called its elements. By
			"well-defined" we mean that there is a rule that enables
			one to determine whether a given object is an element of
			the set or not. If a set has no elements, it is called the
			empty set and is denoted `\varnothing` or `\{\}`.
		</def>

		<p>
            A set is usually specified either by listing all of its
            elements inside a pair of braces or by stating the
            property that determines whether or not an object `x`
            belongs to the set. For example, we might write:

            \[ X = \{ x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \} \]
            
            for a set containing elements `x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n`, or
        
		    \[ X = \{ x \mid x \text{ satisfies } P \} \]
        
		    if each `x` in `X` satisfies a certain property `P`.
        </p>
		<p>
            Because elements in a set are distinct, we do not allow
            repeats. In other words, the sets
            
		    \[ \{1, 3, 2, 2\} \quad \text{and} \quad \{1, 3, 2\} \]

            are the same, that is,

            \[ \{1, 3, 2, 2\} = \{1, 3, 2\}. \]
        </p>

		<p>Also, the order of the elements in a set is irrelevant. So,
		    \[ \{1, 2, 3\} = \{1, 3, 2\} = \{3, 2, 1\}. \]

        </p>

		<def num="1.2.2" name="Membership">
            When considering if an object is an element of
		    a set or not, the symbol `\in` means "is an element of" and
		    `\notin` means "is not an element of."
		</def>

		<ex num="1.2.3" name="Membership">
            Let `A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}`. To denote that `2` is an element
		    of the set `A`, we write `2 \in A`. To denote that `5` is
		    not an element of `A`, we write `5 \notin A`.
        </ex>

		<p>Some famous sets include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>`\mathbb{N} = \{ n \mid n \text{ is a natural number} \} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}`;</li>
			<li>`\mathbb{Z} = \{ n \mid n \text{ is an integer} \} = \{\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}`;</li>
			<li>`\mathbb{Q} = \{ r \mid r \text{ is a rational number} \} = \{ p/q \mid p, q \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ where } q \neq 0 \}`;</li>
			<li>`\mathbb{R} = \{ x \mid x \text{ is a real number} \}`;</li>
			<li>`\mathbb{C} = \{ z \mid z \text{ is a complex number} \}`.</li>
		</ul>
