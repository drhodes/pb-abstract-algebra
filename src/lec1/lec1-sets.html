		<h3>1.2. Sets and Equivalence Relations</h3>

		<div class="definition">
			<p><b>Definition 1.2.1.</b> A set is a well-defined
			collection of distinct objects. The objects of a set are
			called its elements. By “well-defined” we mean that there
			is a rule that enables one to determine whether a given
			object is an element of the set or not. If a set has no
			elements, it is called the empty set and is denoted
			`\varnothing` or `\{\}`.</p>
		</div>

		<p>A set is usually specified either by listing all of its elements inside a pair of braces or by stating the property that determines whether or not an object <code>x</code> belongs to the set. For example, we might write:</p>

		<p>`X = \{ x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \}`</p>
		<p>for a set containing elements <code>x₁, x₂, …, xₙ</code>, or</p>
		<p>`X = \{ x \mid x \text{ satisfies } P \}`</p>
		<p>if each <code>x</code> in <code>X</code> satisfies a certain property <code>P</code>.</p>

		<p>Because elements in a set are distinct, we do not allow repeats. In other words, the sets</p>
		<p>`\{1, 3, 2, 2\}` and `\{1, 3, 2\}` are the same, that is, `\{1, 3, 2, 2\} = \{1, 3, 2\}`.</p>

		<p>Also, the order of the elements in a set is irrelevant. So,</p>
		<p>`\{1, 2, 3\} = \{1, 3, 2\} = \{3, 2, 1\}`.</p>

		<div class="definition">
			<p><b>Definition 1.2.2.</b> When considering if an object is an element of a set or not, the symbol `\in` means “is an element of” and `\notin` means “is not an element of.”</p>
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			<p><b>Example 1.2.3.</b> Let `A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}`. To denote that `2` is an element of the set `A`, we write `2 \in A`. To denote that `5` is not an element of `A`, we write `5 \notin A`.</p>
		</div>

		<p>Some famous sets include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>`\mathbb{N} = \{ n \mid n \text{ is a natural number} \} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}`;</li>
			<li>`\mathbb{Z} = \{ n \mid n \text{ is an integer} \} = \{\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}`;</li>
			<li>`\mathbb{Q} = \{ r \mid r \text{ is a rational number} \} = \{ p/q \mid p, q \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ where } q \neq 0 \}`;</li>
			<li>`\mathbb{R} = \{ x \mid x \text{ is a real number} \}`;</li>
			<li>`\mathbb{C} = \{ z \mid z \text{ is a complex number} \}`.</li>
		</ul>
