    <h4>Definition 3.2.5.</h4>
    <p>
        We say that `(G, \circ)` is a group if the following three axioms are satisfied by the binary operation:
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <b>Associativity:</b>
            For all `g, h, k \in G`, it holds that
            \[ g \circ (h \circ k) = (g \circ h) \circ k. \]
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Identity:</b>

            There exists an element `e \in G` such that for all `g \in
            G` we have
            \[ g \circ e = e \circ g = g. \]
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Inverses:</b>
            For all `g \in G` there is an element `g^{-1} \in G` such
            that
            \[ g \circ g^{-1} = g^{-1} \circ g = e. \]
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        When the binary operation `\circ` is clear from context, we will say that `G` is a group instead of `(G, \circ)`.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, we say `G` is an Abelian group if `G` is a group which satisfies an additional axiom:
    </p>
    <ol type="d">
        <li>
            <b>Commutativity:</b> For all `g, h \in G`, it holds that
            <br>
            \[ g \circ h = h \circ g. \]
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        For Abelian groups, the operation is often denoted as `+`, the identity as `0`, and the inverse of `a` as `-a`.
    </p>

    <h4>Example 3.2.6.</h4>
    <p>
        The structures `(\mathbb{Z}, +)`, `(\mathbb{Q}, +)`,
        `(\mathbb{R}, +)`, and `(\mathbb{C}, +)` are all Abelian
        groups, where the identity element is `0` and the inverse of
        `x` is just `-x`. The structure `(\mathbb{N}, +)` is not a
        group because not all elements have an additive inverse
        (e.g. `-1 \notin \mathbb{N}`). The set `\mathbb{Z}^+` of
        positive integers with addition is also not a group since it
        has no identity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, `(\mathbb{Q}^*, \cdot)`, `(\mathbb{R}^*, \cdot)`,
        and `(\mathbb{C}^*, \cdot)` are all Abelian groups, where the
        identity element is `1` and the inverse of `x` is just
        `\frac{1}{x}`, but `(\mathbb{N}^*, \cdot)` and `(\mathbb{Z}^*,
        \cdot)` are not because not all elements have inverses.
    </p>
    <p>
        The structures `(\mathbb{Z}, -)`, `(\mathbb{Q}, -)`,
        `(\mathbb{R}, -)`, and `(\mathbb{C}, -)` are not
        groups. Although each set has an identity and all elements
        have inverses, the operation is not associative. Note that \[
        3 - (2 - 1) = 3 - 1 = 2 \neq 0 = 1 - 1 = (3 - 2) - 1. \] Of
        course, the operation of subtraction is noncommutative.
    </p>
    <p>
        The structure `(X^X, \circ)` where `\circ` is just function
        composition and `(S_X, \circ)` with permutation multiplication
        (function composition) are both non-Abelian groups since their
        binary operation is noncommutative. The group `S_X` is called
        the symmetric group on `X`.
    </p>

    <h4>Example 3.2.7.</h4>
    <p>
        The set of congruence classes modulo `n`, `\mathbb{Z}_n =
        \{[0], [1], [2], \dots, [n-1]\}`, is an Abelian group under
        addition.

        The identity element of `\mathbb{Z}_n` is the congruence class
        of all multiples of `n`, namely `[0]`.

        For a congruence class `[k]`, the inverse is the class `[-k]`.

        The fact that addition is associative and commutative is an
        immediate consequence of associativity and commutativity on
        `(\mathbb{Z}, +)` and the division algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
        When working with `\mathbb{Z}_n`, it is common to identify a
        class `[k]` with its unique representative between `0` and
        `n`, that is, `\mathbb{Z}_n = \{0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1\}` and `k
        + \ell` is the unique representative of `[k+\ell]` between `0`
        and `n`.

        With this notation, the identity of `\mathbb{Z}_n` is `0` and
        the inverse of `k` is `n-k`.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let `\mathbb{Z}_n^* = \{ k \in \mathbb{Z}_n \mid \gcd(k, n) =
        1 \}` (the book uses the notation `U(n)` to denote the set of
        units in `\mathbb{Z}_n`).

        Then `(\mathbb{Z}_n^*, \cdot)` is also an Abelian group where
        the identity is `1`.

        The Euclidean algorithm is used to compute inverses in this
        group because it computes a linear combination `ak + bn = 1`
        which implies that `ak = 1 - bn`, that is, `ak \equiv 1 \
        (\text{mod } n)`. Thus, `a = k^{-1}`.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Note:</em> These algebraic structures only have a right
        identity, that is, an element `e` such that `g \circ e = g`
        for all `g \in G`.

        Similarly, one can define a left identity as an element `e`
        such that `e \circ g = g` for all `g \in G`. A left- or
        right-identity is called a one-sided identity.
    </p>
    <p>
        It can be proven that with an associative operation, a
        one-sided identity is necessarily a two-sided identity and is
        unique.

        Analogous definitions and statements hold for one- and
        two-sided inverses.
