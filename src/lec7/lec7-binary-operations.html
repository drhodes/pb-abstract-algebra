  <h3>3.2. Definitions and Examples</h3>

  <p>
    In this chapter we introduce the most fundamental and most important structure in abstract algebra, the group.
  </p>

  <h4>Definition 3.2.1.</h4>
  <p>
    A binary operation `\circ` on a set `G` is a function 
    `\circ : G \times G \to G`. For an element `(a,b) \in G \times G`, the image of `(a,b)` under 
    `\circ` is denoted `a \circ b` (or just juxtaposition `ab` when the operation is clear from context), 
    that is, `(a,b) \mapsto a \circ b`. We will use the notation `(G, \circ)` to denote that `G` is a set 
    and `\circ` a binary operation on `G`.
  </p>

  <h4>Example 3.2.2.</h4>
  <p>
    Addition and multiplication are binary operations on `\mathbb{N}`, `\mathbb{Z}`, `\mathbb{Q}`, `\mathbb{R}`, 
    and `\mathbb{C}`. Addition and multiplication also are binary operations on `\mathbb{Z}_n`, the set of congruence 
    classes modulo `n`.
  </p>
  <p>
    Vector addition is a binary operation on `\mathbb{R}^n`. On the other hand, scalar multiplication of vectors is not a 
    binary operation because it is a product of a scalar and a vector producing a vector, i.e. `\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n`. 
    To be a binary operation, the two factors and the product must all be elements of the same set. Likewise, the dot product of two 
    vectors is not a binary operation since it is a function of the form 
    `\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}` (the product is not a vector but a scalar). Conversely, the cross product on 
    `\mathbb{R}^3` is a binary operation `\mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3` since the product of two vectors is a vector.
  </p>
  <p>
    Matrix multiplication is a binary operation on the set of `n \times n` matrices with real scalars, 
    `M_n(\mathbb{R})`, but not on the set of all matrices because the product of two matrices might be undefined if the dimensions 
    are incompatible. This is just a special case of function composition. Recall that for sets `A` and `B`, the set `BA` consists 
    of all functions `f: A \to B`. Then while function composition does not form a binary operation for all functions (since many composites are undefined), 
    it does form a binary operation on `X`, that is, on functions of the form `f: X \to X`.
