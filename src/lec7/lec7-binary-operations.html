    <h1> Lecture 3: Groups </h1>

    <p>
      In this chapter we introduce the most fundamental and most important structure in abstract algebra, the group.

      A <term>binary operation</term> `\circ` on a set `G` is a
      function `{\circ : G \times G \to G}`.

      For an element `(a,b) \in G \times G`, the image of `(a,b)`
      under `\circ` is denoted `a \circ b` (or just juxtaposition `ab`
      when the operation is clear from context), that is, `(a,b)
      \mapsto a \circ b`.

      We will use the notation `(G, \circ)` to denote that `G` is a set and
      `\circ` a binary operation on `G`.

      Addition and multiplication are binary operations on
      `\mathbb{N}`, `\mathbb{Z}`, `\mathbb{Q}`, `\mathbb{R}`, and
      `\mathbb{C}`. Addition and multiplication also are binary
      operations on `\mathbb{Z}_n`, the set of congruence classes
      modulo `n`.

      <p>
        Vector addition is a binary operation on `\mathbb{R}^n`. On
        the other hand, scalar multiplication of vectors is not a
        binary operation because it is a product of a scalar and a
        vector producing a vector, i.e.  `\mathbb{R} \times
        \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n`.
        
        To be a binary operation, the two factors and the product must all be
        elements of the same set. 
        
        Likewise, the dot product of two vectors is not a binary operation since
        it is a function of the form `\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \to
        \mathbb{R}` (the product is not a vector but a scalar). 
        
        Conversely, the cross product on `\mathbb{R}^3` is a binary operation
        `\mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3` since the product of
        two vectors is a vector.
      </p>
      <p>
        Matrix multiplication is a binary operation on the set of `n \times n`
        matrices with real scalars, `M_n(\mathbb{R})`, but not on the set of all
        matrices because the product of two matrices might be undefined if the
        dimensions are incompatible. This is just a special case of function
        composition. Recall that for sets `A` and `B`, the set `BA` consists of
        all functions `f: A \to B`. Then while function composition does not
        form a binary operation for all functions (since many composites are
        undefined), it does form a binary operation on `X`, that is, on
        functions of the form `f: X \to X`.
