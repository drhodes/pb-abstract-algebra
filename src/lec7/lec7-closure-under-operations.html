        When a binary operation `\circ` is defined on a set `X`, we say that
        a subset `Y \subseteq X` is <term>closed</term> under `\circ` if the
        restriction of `\circ` to `Y` forms a binary operation on `Y`, that
        is, if `a, b \in Y` then `a \circ b \in Y`.

        Subtraction is a binary operation for `\mathbb{Z}`, `\mathbb{Q}`,
        `\mathbb{R}`, and `\mathbb{C}`.

        Note that subtraction is <strong>NOT</strong> a binary operation for
        `\mathbb{N}` since the difference of two natural numbers need not be
        a natural number, e.g. `3 - 7 = -4 \notin \mathbb{N}`.

        In other words, `\mathbb{N}` is not closed under subtraction.

      Division is not a binary operation for `\mathbb{Z}`,
      `\mathbb{Q}`, `\mathbb{R}`, nor `\mathbb{C}` since division by
      zero is undefined.

      Let `\mathbb{Z}^*, \mathbb{Q}^*, \mathbb{R}^*,` and
      `\mathbb{C}^*` denote the subset of nonzero numbers of
      `\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R},` and `\mathbb{C}`,
      respectively.

      Then division is a binary operation on `\mathbb{Q}^*,
      \mathbb{R}^*,` and `\mathbb{C}^*`, but not for `\mathbb{Z}^*`
      since the quotient of two integers need not be a nonzero integer,
      e.g. `1 \div 2 = \frac{1}{2} \notin \mathbb{Z}^*`.

      Thus, `\mathbb{Z}^*` is not closed under division.

      The set of permutations `S_X` is closed under composition
      inside of `X^X`. In this case, function composition is
      typically called permutation multiplication.
