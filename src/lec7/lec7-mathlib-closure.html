    <p>
        Since we're mainly working with types and not sets, closure for binary
        operations is naturally expressed by the type `{α → α → α}`, and
        is strictly enforced by the type system.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the previous lecture, examples of binary operations were given, such
        as addition and subtraction. A number of type classes are available in
        mathlib that provide common interfaces for defining these binary
        operations.

    <p>
        <br>
        <b>Example: Add</b>

    <pre>
class Add (α : Type u) where
  /-- `a + b` computes the sum of `a` and `b`. See `HAdd`. -/
  add : α → α → α
    </pre>

    </p>

    <p>
        If we're working with a custom type and would like to define addition
        for it, then we can implement <code>Add</code> which enable the use of
        <code>+</code>.  Analogously, the same is true for <code>Sub</code> with
        the caveats mention in lecture on closure.
