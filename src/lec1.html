                <p>This lecture introduces mathematical group theory at a level
                    suitable for enthusiastic undergraduates and first-year graduate
                    students. The course focuses on examples rather than proofs and
                    covers topics such as finite groups, symmetric groups, free
                    groups, reflection groups, and more. Each video will link to the
                    next lecture and the complete lecture playlist.</p>

                <p>A group is defined as the collection of all symmetries of an
                    object. A symmetry is a mapping from the object to itself that
                    preserves its structure.</p>

                            the total symmetry count becomes `120`.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Classification:</strong> Classifying
                        all “interesting” groups up to
                        isomorphism. Two groups are isomorphic if
                        there exists a bijective map between them that
                        preserves the group operation, meaning they
                        are essentially the same despite relabeling.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Representation Theory:</strong> Studying
                        the ways in which groups act on sets
                        (permutation representations) or on vector
                        spaces (linear representations). This provides
                        insights into the structure of groups by
                        relating them to well-understood groups like
                        symmetric and general linear groups.

                <p>The three axioms (associativity, identity,
                inverses) form a complete set for defining a
                group. That is, any set that satisfies these axioms is
                isomorphic to the symmetry group of some mathematical
                object. This result is known as Cayley’s Theorem and
